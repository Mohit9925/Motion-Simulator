# Motion Simulator

![Motion Simulator Demo](simulatorgif.gif)

Motion Simulator is a Python-based simulation project using Pygame and Pymunk, designed to replicate real-world physics phenomena. It provides a platform to explore and visualize concepts like collision, friction, elasticity, damping, and gravity in a digital environment.

## Features

- **Realistic Physics**: Motion Simulator accurately simulates real-world physics, ensuring that objects behave as they would in the physical world.
- **Collision**: Experience realistic object interactions, including collisions and rebounds.
- **Friction**: Objects slow down gradually when in contact with surfaces due to friction.
- **Elasticity**: Observe objects deforming upon impact and regaining their original shape.
- **Damping**: Simulate the effects of friction and air resistance, causing objects to come to rest naturally.
- **Gravity**: Experience the gravitational pull, influencing object movement and acceleration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run Motion Simulator, you'll need:

- Python (>= 3.x)
- Pygame
- Pymunk

You can install Pygame and Pymunk using pip:

```shell
pip install pygame
pip install pymunk
pip install pygame_gui
